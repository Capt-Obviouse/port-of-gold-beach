            <h2>Huntley Park</h2>
            Visit lovely Huntley Park Riverside Campground and R.V. Park. Located 7 miles east of Gold Beach on the bank
            of the beautiful Rogue River. Easily accessed by way of Jerry&#8217;s Flat (South Bank) Road, the park
            offers 70 secluded &#8217;dry&#8217; camp sites with tables and fire rings. Firewood is available for a
            nominal fee. A Restroom / Shower room provides all the amenities of larger facilities, but on a smaller and
            more friendly scale. A day use area with road access to the gravel bar is at the downriver end of the park.
            Our on-site managers have a wealth of local information and lore and are able to help with most requests.
            Trails for hiking and mountain biking can be accessed from the park, with miles of fun for those who so
            desire. Or you can simply sit under a Myrtlewood tree by the river and listen for the splash of a jumping
            salmon being chased by a family of river otters. Click here for rates and a map. We look forward to you
            joining us at Huntley Park. For more information on Huntley Park and camping, please call 541-247-9377.
