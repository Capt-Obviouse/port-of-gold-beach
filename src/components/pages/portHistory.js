            Established in 1955, the Gold Beach Port District has grown to own and manage a diverse portfolio of
            interests in the Gold Beach area. The original Cannery Building was constructed by Jerry Hull in 1968. The
            building was constructed when the ocean troll salmon fishing off the mouth of the Rogue River was at
            it&#39;s peak. In 1974, with the addition of a shrimp and crab fishery, the two story full scale seafood
            processing plant was constructed. The plant contained shrimp, crab, and salmon processing equipment. Between
            1974 and 1984 the facility changed hands 3 times. From 1986 until the present decreases in non-tribal troll
            fisheries had a negative effect on the plant&#39;s ability to operate profitably. In 1991 the cannery
            facility was sub-leased for sea urchin processing. With the need to diversify from the fishing industry the
            Port decided to renovate the Cannery. In March 1998 the doors opened to the newly renovated cannery
            building. Port interests now include the port, the airport, and Huntley Park.
