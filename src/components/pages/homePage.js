              Visit lovely Huntley Park Riverside Campground and R.V. Park. Located 7 miles east of Gold Beach on the
              bank of the beautiful Rogue River. Easily accessed by way of Jerry&#39;s Flat (South Bank) Road, the park
              offers 70 secluded &#39;dry&#39; camp sites with tables and fire rings. Firewood is available for a
              nominal fee. A Restroom / Shower room provides all the amenities of larger facilities, but on a smaller
              and more friendly scale. A day use area with road access to the gravel bar is at the downriver end of the
              park. Our on-site managers have a wealth of local information and lore and are able to help with most
              requests.
