              The mission of the Planning Advisory Committee (PAC) is to advise Port staff and the Planning Team, led by
              WHPacific, Inc., on issues of community interest with respect to providing safe, efficient and convenient
              air transportation for Gold Beach and Curry County residents and businesses, while at the same time
              maintaining and respecting the interests of the Airport&#39;s neighbors and the environment. The Port
              selected the PAC by choosing members that represent public and private interests as well as airport users.
